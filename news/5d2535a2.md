Efficient data center infrastructure is foundational to business operations and overall success. Data is often referred to as the new gold or oil. Selecting and deploying servers and storage systems to maximize those precious resources—within a given footprint and budget is crucial to operations. The benefits of an efficient data center infrastructure and how the right solutions can help optimize your servers and storage systems are outlined below. 




Importance of Efficient Data Center Infrastructure
--------------------------------------------------




Infrastructure is absolutely critical to your business. But companies need to think of storage as more than an IT component. Data center infrastructure contributes incredible value to the business because of its impact on customer trust and brand reputation. Yes, data centers serve as the backbone for storing and processing data, but their fundamental role is to maintain the integrity and security of customer (and company) information.




Reliable [data center servers and storage systems](/products/storage/data-storage-systems/) demonstrate a commitment to customer data security and privacy. The right storage ensures uninterrupted operations and minimal downtime, so systems run smoothly and deliver consistent experiences to customers.




An often-forgotten component of choosing the right data center infrastructure is the environmental benefit. Although data centers are known for extensive energy consumption, with carefully selected storage that optimizes resources they have the potential to drive positive changes when it comes to sustainability.




Energy-efficient hardware and storage devices can help minimize power consumption while maintaining high performance. Even though energy efficiency and sustainability may not be the first consideration when evaluating data center infrastructure, these outcomes can have a considerable impact on a company's environmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals.




### High-Performance Servers for Data-Intensive Workloads




Companies can ensure their servers will handle data-intensive workloads by taking the following measures:


* **Identify workload requirements:** Understand specific requirements of data-intensive workloads, including power, memory, and storage demands. Analyzing the nature of those workloads and their projected growth will determine the necessary server specifications.
* **Select the right hardware:** Thoroughly evaluate different server options and then choose hardware that aligns with workload requirements. This includes processor speed, core count, memory capacity, storage options, and network connectivity.
* **Optimize and tune:** Once servers deploy, optimize performance by fine-tuning network parameters.
* **Monitor performance:** Monitoring metrics such as CPU utilization, memory utilization, disk I/O, and network bandwidth help identify areas where administrators can optimize storage.
* **Plan for capacity requirements:** The state of data changes quickly. Conduct capacity planning exercises to identify potential constraints and make informed decisions about upgrades or purchasing new hardware.
* **Update firmware and software:** Regular updates to server firmware and software provide performance enhancements, bug fixes, and security patches. This protects servers from potential vulnerabilities.




### Scalable Server Architecture for Growing Demands




Scalable server architecture is another crucial component of efficient data center infrastructure. When businesses can expand computing resources, they're able to handle growing data demands effectively and allocate resources to optimize performance.




To ensure the effectiveness of scalable server architecture for growing data demands, companies can follow these best practices:


* **Capacity planning:** Evaluate the expected growth rate, workload patterns, and performance requirements to determine the appropriate level of scalability necessary for server architecture.
* **Modularity and standardization:** These features ensure integration proceeds with no hiccups, components are interoperable with each other and existing components, and maintenance is simplified. It also future-proofs the architecture investment.
* **Virtualization and cloud tech:** Both virtualization and cloud services can provide scalable computing resources on demand.
* **Automation and orchestration:** Ensure efficient resource provisioning, configuration management, and workload distribution with automation tools that reduce human involvement. Orchestration ensures companies can scale infrastructure holistically without major disruptions.
* **Collaboration with the right partners:** Collaborating with the right technology partners allows companies to find components that offer the right balance between cost optimization and high performance, no matter what data needs look like now or in the future.




### Reliability and Data Security in Servers




Data integrity and security ensure long-term operations and reduce risks — both from security breaches and accidental data loss due to human error. Servers should incorporate robust reliability and data security features to safeguard critical data assets. These features include redundant components, fault tolerance mechanisms, and advanced data protection technologies.




Self-encrypting drives (SEDs) can protect data at rest by encrypting it and protecting against unauthorized access. Secure data erasure methods help prevent improperly deleted data. Security helps companies maximize the use of both servers and storage.
