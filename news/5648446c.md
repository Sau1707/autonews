Digital content has become today's primary channel for media consumption. While a digital transformation strategy has been crucial to upgrading the end-user experience for media and entertainment companies, it also improves a company's backend operations by enabling new efficiencies and capabilities.â¯




Digital transformation can help your company improve productivity and performance, create new value from your products and services, and scale your operations and customer base faster. With flexible, powerful technology supporting this infrastructure, your company can lay a foundation for efficient operations and frictionless growth.â¯




What Is a Digital Transformation Strategy?â¯
---------------------------------------------




The pace of digital innovation continues to accelerate across all industries as companies seek new business models with more efficient, flexible operations that control costs, eliminate inefficiencies, and improve the experience delivered to their customers.â¯




Most businesses prioritize digital transformation with the goal of optimizing at least one of the following:â¯




### Performance and Value Creationâ¯




Manual tasks, inefficient workflows, unforced errors, and slower delivery all affect the performance of individual teams and your company as a whole.




Digital transformation uses digital processes, automation, flexible architecture, and system-wide security to elevate performance throughout your business. Streamlined workflows, better data availability, and higher overall productivity coming together to create new value for your customers and company.â¯




### Products and Services




Even if your business has invested in a strong digital experience for end-users, an inflexible business infrastructure can affect the quality of these products and services.â¯




Poor integration of software solutions can undercut the performance of your company's products. Inefficient business processes can slow down your ability to iterate new solutions and keep pace with your competition. And, as your customer base for various products and services grows, inflexible infrastructure will struggle to perform at scale.â¯




### Operational Efficiencyâ¯




From [data storage costs](/blog/what-is-cloud-cost-optimization-for-multi-cloud/) to inefficient energy consumption, poor-performing operations can lead to high costs that undercut your company's revenue generation. A digital transformation strategy can guide investment into flexible [data storage solutions](/products/storage/data-storage-systems/) that [optimize data management and resource utilization](/blog/what-is-cloud-cost-optimization-for-multi-cloud/) while improving security for on-premise and hybrid environments.




What Are the Four Main Focal Points of a Digital Transformation Strategy?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------




Digital transformation is not an initiative restricted to your IT department. It is all-encompassing, reshaping how entire departments, business processes, and the overall company culture are designed and supported.â¯




For media and entertainment companies, digital transformation is an opportunity to reconsider the existing business model and its underlying business processes. New digital technologies can be implemented to build an infrastructure that enables new, improved ways of doing business.




As you develop a digital strategy for directing this transformation, make sure you address the following key areas.â¯




### Adaptive Work Methodologyâ¯




New digital technologies give your business the digital tools it needs to optimize operations at the process level. The integration of innovative, flexible solutions also allows your business to reconsider its approach to work, steering operations away from past inefficiencies and enabling a more flexible, adaptive approach that improves performance and reduces waste.




### Innovation Cultureâ¯




Technology alone does not spark a cultural change in any organization. But technology can be used to eliminate processes and other modes of work that may reinforce employee bad habits.â¯




In that sense, new technology can be used to jump-start a larger, company-wide culture shift by forcing business leaders to [align digital transformation with new internal values](/blog/what-are-the-4-main-areas-of-digital-transformation/). By implementing solutions that improve productivity and align individuals and teams with the same collective goals, your business can achieve a cultural change that further increases the value of your digital technologies.â¯




### Agility at Scaleâ¯




New technology investments should meet your company's present-day needs, but also support your long-term growth. For media and entertainment companies, one of the biggest concerns regarding long-term scalability is the flexibility and cost-effectiveness of its [data storage systems](/products/storage/data-storage-systems/).â¯




Modern data storage and management needs to allow for efficient scaling of initial storage investments, particularly in a [multi-cloud](/cloud/solutions/multicloud/) environment. This scalability must also offer cost-efficiencies to help organizations protect their profit margins and incentivize growth.




Solutions such as edge computing improve data management by processing data closer to its point of creation. This brings enterprise applications closer to internet of things (IoT) devices and servers, reducing latency while enabling large volumes of data to be [processed and turned around at scale](/blog/what-is-edge-computing/).




### Product Shiftâ¯




Through new digital technologies and a remaking of your business culture, digital transformation can help achieve a product shift that reconsiders how people and financial resources are used to create value within the organization.â¯â¯




By automating certain [data management processes](/products/storage/data-storage-systems/raid/), businesses can reallocate employee skills and capabilities to focus on other value-added projects. These new resource efficiencies allow organizations to innovate at market speed and achieve [performance results that are sustainable and scalable](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/cio-insider-business-insights/three-keys-to-building-organizational-agility.html).â¯




The Benefits of Digital Transformation in Mediaâ¯
--------------------------------------------------




Digital transformation can help media and entertainment companies achieve a wide range of efficiencies that reduce operating costs, increase revenue generation, and improve the end-user experience.â¯â¯




As digital media ecosystems continue to grow in volume and complexity, the efficiencies will become an even greater difference-maker in determining how quickly and effectively businesses can scale their operations. Here are some of the most impactful changes digital transformation can bring to media and entertainment businesses.â¯




### Real-Time Bookingâ¯




The exponential growth of digital ad spaces has increased the challenges of managing these digital bookings—especially when attempting to maximize ad revenue while identifying high-value ad placements for advertisers.â¯




Real-time booking uses automation tools to fill these ad spots while avoiding double-bookings that can cost the media agency money while frustrating its advertisers. Real-time data and automated booking streamline the process for advertisers while reducing the manual labor required to manage inventories. This improves the customer experience, making it easy to manage ad bookings at scale.â¯




### Automation of Manual Tasksâ¯




Ad inventory management is only one way automation is reallocating resources to create new efficiencies. Data collection, data management, and storage configuration are just a few of the ways automation can be used to control costs, optimize resource utilization, and free up your employees to focus on customer service, customer satisfaction, and other processes requiring a human touch.




### Access to Real-Time Data and Analyticsâ¯




Better information leads to better decision-making. [Real-time data and intelligent data analytics](https://www.seagate.com/cloud/data-analytics/) can uncover a wealth of new insights to improve how your business runs. Data storage, energy management, and real-time security monitoring can all make your business more proactive in making timely changes that reduce costs and mitigate risk.â¯




Over time, these insights can guide process efficiencies that streamline operations and accelerate performance.




Best Practices for Designing a Scalable Data Centerâ¯
------------------------------------------------------




Successful digital transformation requires a flexible data center to fully support ongoing innovation and technology investments. While your company's data center should be designed with present and future business needs in mind, certain best practices should be followed to ensure the best short-term fit and long-term value.â¯




### Always-On Data Resiliencyâ¯




Always-on data availability improves your data management processes by ensuring high data availability while reducing the risk of a data loss. Always-on availability plays a critical role in any disaster recovery and business continuity program, improving the resiliency of your data by making sure it can be accessed even in an emergency.â¯
